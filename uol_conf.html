 &gt; ### .pink[Economic theory dictates that if a CAD is being financed by borrowing, with associated costs, it will become unsustainable and today the rise in domestic and foreign debt has crossed all previous records. In addition, loss of currency from Rs.152 to Rs.200 rupees to the dollar would raise the risk of capital flight as there will be loss of faith in the value of currency by both foreign and residents. Pakistan has gone through this boom and bust cycles many times before: an import-driven boom, balance of payments crisis, International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout, stabilisation, a period of growth and then back to a crisis. This time is no different.]

### Decades long struggle with macroeconomic stabilization arising from unsustainable fiscal policies 
### Growth dilema, Low Economic Growth, Compounding  
### ⬆️growth   ➡️CAD ⬆️ 


### Low and declining economic productivity 
 
### Stagnant Export  , High Unemployment

### NFC, Provincial tax structure, ....

Devolution is good with responsibility but NFC 
More resources to provinces but w/o liability of raising revenue

###  Pakistan economy crashes every once in a while: feature by design 
####   Very low investment rate 
|Country| Private Investment (%of GDP)|
|-------|-----------|
|Pakistan| 10%|
|Bangladesh/India| 20-25%|
####   Fiscal problem: For every USD govt raises in revenue, it has to spend 2.7 USD 
####  Income 1000 USD, spending 2700 USD, Balance of Payment: X=1000, M=2750 USD
####   Sins: SOEs, Rent Seeking, pensions
####   If no borrowing, country to shut down
####   Liquidity Problem: Short maturity term on average 1 to 2 years

## [The exchange rate challenge](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40172209/the-exchange-rate-challenge)

### Growth can come through improving exports in industry, agriculture and services. 
### Exchange rate: Policy instrument
- #### Price stability through overrated ER or
- #### market based value?
???
Price stability for short run by injecting USD into market, not sustainable (neither enough reserves nor can be done for long)
Export becomes uncompetitive
Overvalued ER: only for textile where import is major component 
But loss of reserves 
False pride in overvalued rupees
RER= supply and demand are in balance. To put simply, the value of exports and the sum of immigrant remittances must be about the same as the import, the expense our foreign travels, plus payment against foreign investments.

???

## .orange[Exchange rate is considered in Pakistan as a barometer of pride. The higher the value of Pak Rs., higher our self-esteem. In practice, overvalued exchange rate helps in having stable price level in the short run, if one has enough reserves which unfrotunately we dont have. But its damage in terms of becoming uncompetitive far outweighs its benefits of price stability]

## Sustained Flawed Policies
####  Costly energy deals beneficials to sellers
####  Power generation plants on same TORs as Zardari
####  Failure to import RLNG on time
####  Unsustainable circular debt: Rs. 1.2 trillion in 2018 before PTI government &amp; now 2.4 trillion Rs 
#### Little room to play : Debt, Defence, Pension, Government Expenditure, with ex-PM focus for more resources to Kamyab Jawan and Ehsas program.

#### Succesive governments fulfilled their commitment of shifting the burden to consumers but never fulfills its commitment of deep structural reforms 
???
 The sustained flawed policies over decades of postponing the hour of reckoning have not only made the donors reluctant to accept pledges for meaningful non-reversible reforms, a situation exacerbated by lack of US support on their boards, but also due to the presentation of half-truths to the executive which prevents meaningful reforms.

Pakistan has fundamentally unsustainable model
Business to make money= Real Estate
money increase due to appreciation of land but unproductive side for GDP
-Land: Rent seeking
When lot of value is generated through a non productive sector, it generates demand which leads to increase in goods and services impying to more import[oil, cars, other Goods and Services]
- Are these individuals producing something to be sold in international market?
IT, car manufacturing....
Value generation: unproductive

## Why Export Matters
- global competitiveness 

- Capacity to innovate and compete with the rest of the world 

- 1992: Indian export increased 13 times while Pak only doubles 

- Vietnam : 15 B USD in 2001 and 250 B USD in 2020  

- Export per capital India increased by 6.8 times while BD by 6.2 as compared to Pakistan 
    - Competitiveness as compared to neighboring countries

- Export : dynamism, technology absorption and adaptation, building reputation, brand names , enployment

- Sports, textile, surgical: no branding 


- Reasons: Mangerial skills, organizational skills  
---

&gt; # .zomp[A survey quoted by .pink[*The Economist*] magazine (Feb 8th, 2021) of the Indian economy stated that a billion dollars of export growth in industry leads to the employment of 400,000 workers.]

### Whether correct or not, but its obvious export leads to huge employment. Pakistan export is labour intensive, so increase in export will lead to increase in employment.

### ER4export, China
???
More than fixed exchange rate, intelligent management is needed. China is a case in point which kept ER continuously undervalued and dominated international export market.

???
 World Bank Report on Reviving Pakistan Exports

#### Senior economist WB rightly points out: 

&gt;####     The long term decline in exports as a share of GDP has implications for the country's -foreign exchange-, -jobs- and -productivity growth-. Therefore,      confronting core challenges that are necessary for Pakistan to compete in the      global market is an imperative for sustainable growth. 

### The recomendations includes: 

####  1. gradually reduce the real effective rates of protection through a long-term tariff rationalisation strategy to encourage exports. 
####  2. reallocate export financing away from working capital and into capacity exapnsion through the Long-Term Financing Facility. 
####  3. Consolidate market intelligence services by supporting new exporters and evaluating the impact of current inteventions to increase their effectiveness; and 
####  4. Design and implement a long-term strategy to upgrade productivity of firms that fosters competition, innovation and maximises export potential.

???
class: top left 
## The elite illusions and delusions

### The conclusions from the foregoing data and argument are as follows: 
####  1. Pakistan has to learn to live within its means; 
####  2. the country’s obsession with imported cars (and other foreign consumer goods) is unaffordable as well as unsustainable; 
####  3. elitist policymakers would do well to study the development path and policies of successful peer countries; and, 
####  4. the country’s free-riding elites have to be made to carry their share of responsibility.

 : a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule the show-business catch-22—no work unless you have an agent, no agent unless you've worked— Mary Murphy also : the circumstance or rule that denies a solution.

### How to come out of vicious cycle?

&gt; WB Oct,2021 Review: "Pakistan Development Update: Reviving exports 
 Moreover, slash the need to borrow for budgetary support for which reduce expenditure
 
 10+ party coalition
 IMF : 7th review 3 billion dollars, other bilateral will also help

New government has increased energy prices and have made commitment to IMF for increase in fuel prices which is a step in _Good housekeeping_

PSDP has already been cut by Rs.200  to Rs.600/(billions)
Contractionary monetary policy implies reduction in growth rate, low tax revenue
Renegotiate with IMF: Little mild conditions will help for other bilateral agencies

## Solution
Macro policy , macroprudential regulations
ER (flexible), Future stance, Reserves
Capital account judicious use
Narrow definition of sectors, not speculative investment, 
Capital flight
Manage capital account carefully
- Remittance : 10% of the GDP, higher than India, BD, because domestic market not able to generate jobs
-Spare a fraction of remittance on annual basis

-BOP: Energy crisis, local solar plant
-Taxation of land: capital gain tax and spend it in urban infrastructure and developmenti in cities

Go to IMF and monitor the following indicators: 
GDP growth not an only indicator but also include
- Debt to GDP ratio
- Revenue to GDP
- Budget deficit 
- Inflation 

???
## Investment in agriculture
-R&amp;D
- local in nature
- satellite , Big Data

## Leadership positions
-highly talented people
- Human capital
- remain unfulfilled for long time
- Higher education rate but one of the lowest LF participation rate
- S&amp;T pushes a society and helps in growing
- Open society, allow to question


Supply side to be more productive before opening up
Scientific thinking mode rather preaching or political thinking mode
- Post covid-IT sector
-Value chain missing
-Start ups but are other countries prefer to come to Pakistan to invest
No such signs, scaling is important

- Energies are spent in negative wat into building narrative
- Growth leads to TRADE

Why BOP crisis despite ER depreciation 
- One time is ok
But if not consistent, long run investment will not come
- ER as instrument not sufficient , government investment and secure property rights are must for investment

BD textile much better than Pakistan, Why
Because Pakistani upper class has alternative to make money, so why invest in technology
India : value chain within country, 
Pakistan : focus on metros, roads and approach is lets buy from somewhere
- less of willingness for domestic product
-CPEC: not much positive impact, they will build and go away

## Pakistan 13th IMF programs
###  IMF conditions
#### Revnue generation

### Fiscal Deficit target
- #### capital expenditure is included which is not included in other countries.
- #### Need investment instruments rather restricting it by the IMF
- #### History of development in the world
- #### subsidies


Removal of subsidies itself will not solve economic problems automatically.
####  Investment in state capacity: Education, Health
####  independent BOGs for securing investments
  
Balance: Government in public investment in certain sectors and come out of non-productive sectors

# [Growth in imports](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40169472/growth-in-imports)

#### -March 22, 2022 PBS data : import growth rate of 49% Sep-Mar,22
#### - Exports growth : 25% , widening trade deficit by 70%
#### - As a result: $13 billion trade deficit in 9 months


### Number of Questions for this rise
### Reasons

1. What is relative contribution of the rise in volumes and prices?
2. What has been the impact of various fiscal and montertary measures undertaken to contain imports?
3. What the is likelevel of imports in the last quarter of 2021-22?


 
1. rise in price of crude oil from $45 to $109
2. jump in consumption of petroleum products after covid-19 (14%)
3. 347% increase in import bill of medicines due to Covid - will phase out now

## Short term measures
### 1.Reduce import

### 2. Progressive income tax
### 3. Increase Oil prices
???
- Increase tariff on agriculture products , we have opened too much of our economy
- Zero cotton duty and agri products 15 to 30% , while India upto 60%
3 types of items
- food items
- medicines
- fuel 
- maximum income tax bracket : India 10 times that of per capita GDP
-                              Bangladesh 8 times
-                              Pakistan 300 times
Reduce it 20 million from Rs.75 million
Tax on consolidated income not in piecemeal

- Captial Gains Tax : 0 after plot is sold after 3 years

## [How to solve the debt crisis (Arshad Zaman)](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40168756/how-to-solve-the-debt-crisis)

### What can government do to solve debt problem?
__Either__ new another _Last_ IMF
- burden of energy prices/taxation on people
__Or__ find ways to dsitrbute this burden more fairly between people and their creditors. 
#### How?
#### Liquidity issue OR Sustainabitiy issue

#### Why IMF agree for debt relief
- IMF Report 2002: Restructuing if debt unsustainable

### Restructuring Concept
- principal ammount
- interest payment
- time to repay
Either or combination


### Domestic Debt solvency  (SDD)
### Risks from SDD 
- domestic banks
- pension funds
- pensioners 

## 6 Steps for SDD
1. Disaggregate debt stock and flows more minutely and re-classify them by currency, governing laws and citzenship and residence of holders.
2. Indentify exactly domestic debt to be restructured and debt relief targets (DRT) 
3. Deduct associated fiscal costs 
4. Assess wider economic costs associated with restructuring
5. SBP payment systems works normally
6. minimize overall costs but DRT works


### SDD resistance from banks
Rs.1400 billion interest income by top 10 banks which is
- 60% of total domestic debt
- 11% more than defence expenditure
- 26% of total tax revenue 
- 3% of GDP
__FAIR__
_Banks refund some of their excess profits from the debt crisis_

#### How much SDD works
Cyprus: 2013=15 haircuts of 36% more achieved
Greence : 2012 SDD and SFD 65-78%


If former, go for more loan
If not sustainable, then restructing/rescheduling
Pakistan debt is so large that servicing it is reducing investment and adversely affecting incentives to invest, reducing economic growth and ultimately future debt serving capacity.
Govt should go domestic debt solvency only (SDD), why? limited impact on external reputation, and access to external debt market

### Budget deficit : Rs.4900 billion (9% of GDP)

Almost Rs.1500 to Rs.1600 billion deficit, one of the largest in hisotry
We are at the limits of our solvency
### Reasons
Unrealistic budget outlays: increase demand which leads to mushroom growth
### IMF will closely watch shape of the budget
Why this huge budge deficit : Oil prices led to fall in revenue from PL

    - Knowledge generation
- Lucas (1988) Once you start thinking of growth of nations, everything else loses interest,this is the most important questions 

- Amrtya Sen :Dev as Freedom , Capabilities
    - Freedom to think , choices, more productive

- All this needs creative cities
???

- How can start this journey: Hard choice, long term phenomenon

- Economic Corridor : F-16 Protocol (China, Saudia …)

- Government needs similar commitment to software, freedom, tolerance, diversity…

- Intolerance, hate, lack of property rights, social justice, inequality  
(Social Goods) 

???
- Subsidies
- SROs
- Protection
Cement, Textile, Fertilizers, Cars…. (all domestic consumption, no export)
- Profits of rent-seekers are secured
- No need for innovation, and growth is happening only due to increase in population 


## Short-termism: MYOPIC APPROACH
 
 - Successive governments suffering from myopia 
 - Occasional consumption booms from borrowing and remittances (2002-05), 2016-18
 - Increased informal economy weakening state control and governace besides erosion of tax-base
 - Pakistan remained married to begging bowl
 - Sought FDI without terms
 - Pipenomics : Someone build for us
 - Poor aid governance led to poor aid practices
 - This distracts one not to think hard

## Most of economic thinking:

### .orange[“How can living-standards be improved for most of humanity”] 

#### Answers vary while Question remain same 
#### Eternal struggle for mankind 
#### Preachers, utopians philosophers and many others: 

- Dev. Community: prey to descriptive approach 
- Experts: pretend to have solutions 
- We are all told :  Implement, Implement … 
- Monitoring mechanisms: MDGs, SDGs 
- 70 years of experts dev.policy, aid funding and many consultant, plan… 
- Development has eluded a large number of countries : Why is that? 
???
Everyone defends one’s utopia that people lot can be improved if follow their description

### Donors and Experts : Easy answers 
### Prescriptions are not implemented 
### Lack of political will : If success, they celebrate otherwise blame 
### Best practices 
### How can same policies for all countries 
### Approach : Top-down (All solutions from foreign experts)
### Land-cruisers, consultants … results are the same

## What is wrong with this model/approach

#### Ideological models and experts assume: Society and development: Eng phenomenon 
#### Plan properly and then everyone will live according to the plan and good things will happen     

#### Eng: Inert materials 

#### Social problems: self-willed, individualistic human beings 

#### People: ambitions, plans &amp;desires individually and collectively, People don’t change because consultant want 

#### Most serious economists moved away from this approach 
???
- Economy: set of independent and groups decisions 
 - Bottom-up
    - Economy: Productivity, products, activity, trade and exchange, transaction among many others 
    - Even well motivated plans to send children to schools failed
    - Parents decisions more complex than donors assume
    - Development not uniform across the countries

 - Local issues, cultures &amp; community, social and human capital plays a critical role 
 
 - Planners try their best even out these difficult often at huge cost with very little success

???
Revenue Targets missed: More taxes   64 WHT

 - Is starving PSEs and Universities of working capital something to cheer?

 - Complexities of the 21st Century

 - Energy: Lack of professional regularity capacity

 - Rent seeking commitments to IPPs

 - Losses due to structural and poor governance problems

 - Circular debt chokes up the system

???

## Getting the basics right

 - Economy is not rocket science 
 - Qs” What are the basics? 
 - Basics: high revenue, high export, high growth, low dollar rupee ER etc with low inflation 
 - WOW: Simple and easy : Economy is not rocket science 
 - Wishing all good things is economics and economist is supposed to help governments to do all these good things with magic stick 
 - 5-Year plans for all Basics
 
???
### Securing property rights 
- #### Strengthening contracting 
- #### Reducing transaction costs 
- #### Reducing and reforming markets for efficiency 
- #### Removing incentives for rent seeking and putting incentives for entrepreneurship 
- #### For Example : W/o good governance: no wish list will happen as plan after plan failed due to poor governance

 &gt;#### “All of us have to come out of our comfort zone and encourage discussion and debate”

### Hayek, Change and Complexity

&gt;#### It is, perhaps, worth stressing that economic problems arsie always and only in consequences of change. The Use of Knowledge in Society.
